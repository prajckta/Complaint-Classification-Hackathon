OBJECTIVE :
Develop an intelligent system that aims to leverage natural language processing techniques to develop an efficient and accurate system for bank customer complaint analysis, classification.
By automating the classification, financial institutions can enhance their dispute resolution capabilities and improve customer satisfaction.

Choosing the right model:
1.Random Forest:
->Random Forest constructs multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to achieve high accuracy in classification and regression tasks.
->Suitability for our problem statement:
-Ensemble Learning Benefits
-Efficient training
-Robust to overfitting
->Random Forest Accuracy: 0.856

2.Gradient Boosting:
->Gradient Boosting sequentially combines weak learners, where each new learner corrects errors of the previous ones, resulting in a strong model, unlike Random Forest which builds trees independently.
->Suitability for our problem statement
-Handling Non-Linearity
-Sequential Learning
-Handling Missing Data
->Gradient Boosting Accuracy: 0.808
